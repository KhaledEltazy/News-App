# News App

## Description
The News App is an Android application that fetches the latest news from a remote API using the *Retrofit* library. It demonstrates how to integrate *RecyclerView* for displaying lists, the *MVVM* (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, and *Room Database* for local storage. Additionally, the app uses *Navigation Components, including navigation buttons, the **Navigation Graph, and **navArgs* for passing data between fragments.

This project is based on the teachings and concepts from *Philipp Lackner's Android development course*, where modern best practices and practical examples are applied.

## Features
- Fetches news articles from a remote API using Retrofit.
- Displays news articles in a list using RecyclerView.
- Implements MVVM architecture for better separation of concerns.
- Caches news data locally using Room Database.
- Utilizes Navigation Components to manage fragment navigation.
- Passes data between fragments using *navArgs*.

## Technologies Used
- *Retrofit*: For making HTTP requests and handling the API response.
- *RecyclerView*: To display the list of news articles.
- *MVVM*: A design pattern used for structuring the app's code for better maintainability.
- *Room Database*: For offline storage and caching news data.
- *Navigation Component*: For handling navigation between fragments.
- *Navigation Graph*: To define navigation paths and actions.
- *navArgs*: To pass data between fragments safely.
